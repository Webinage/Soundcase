# Soundcase Contributing Guide

Hi! I'm really excited that you are interested in contributing to Soundcase. Before submitting your contribution, please make sure to take a moment and read through the following guidelines:

- [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/soundcase/soundcase/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- [Issue Reporting Guidelines](#issue-reporting-guidelines)
- [Pull Request Guidelines](#pull-request-guidelines)
- [Development Setup](#development-setup)
- [Project Structure](#project-structure)

## Issue Reporting Guidelines

- Always use [https://github.com/Soundcase/Soundcase/issues](https://github.com/Soundcase/Soundcase/issues) to create new issues.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- The `master` branch is just a snapshot of the latest stable release. All development should be done in dedicated branches. **Do not submit PRs against the `master` branch.**

- Checkout a topic branch from the relevant branch, e.g. `dev`, and merge back against that branch.

- Work in the `src` folder and **DO NOT** checkin `dist` in the commits.

- It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR - GitHub will automatically squash it before merging.

- Make sure `npm test` passes. (see [development setup](#development-setup))

- If adding a new feature:

  - Add accompanying test case.
  - Provide a convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally, you should open a suggestion issue first and have it approved before working on it.

- If fixing bug:
  - If you are resolving a special issue, add `(fix #xxxx[,#xxxx])` (#xxxx is the issue id) in your PR title for a better release log, e.g. `update entities encoding/decoding (fix #3899)`.
  - Provide a detailed description of the bug in the PR. Live demo preferred.
  - Add appropriate test coverage if applicable.

## Development Setup

You will need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) **version 8+**, [Java Runtime Environment](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) (for running Selenium server during e2e tests) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

After cloning the repo, run:

```bash
$ yarn # install the dependencies of the project
```

### Committing Changes

Commit messages should follow the [commit message convention](./COMMIT_CONVENTION.md) so that changelogs can be automatically generated. Commit messages will be automatically validated upon commit. If you are not familiar with the commit message convention, you can use `npm run commit` instead of `git commit`, which provides an interactive CLI for generating proper commit messages.

### Commonly used NPM scripts

```bash
# watch and run the documentation app
$ npm run docs

# build all dist files, including npm packages and typings .d.ts files
$ npm run build

# run the full test suite, including linting/type checking
$ npm test
```

<!-- There are some other scripts available in the `scripts` section of the `package.json` file.

The default test script will do the following: lint with ESLint -> type check with Flow -> unit tests with coverage -> e2e tests. **Please make sure to have this pass successfully before submitting a PR.** Although the same tests will be run against your PR on the CI server, it is better to have it working locally. -->

## Project Structure

- **`dist`**: Contains built files for distribution. Note this directory is only available when you build the project from source files with `npm run builg`.

- **`docs`**: Contains the docusaurus documentation. Usually, you don't need to touch them. However, if you plan on documenting the code it would be helpful to familiarize yourself with the following files/folders:

  - `docs/docs/`: Contains all the documentation items. Written in markdown.

  - `docs/website/sidebars.json`: Index and organise all the documentation.

<!-- - **`test`**: contains all tests. The unit tests are written with [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/2.3/introduction.html) and run with [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.13/index.html). The e2e tests are written for and run with [Nightwatch.js](http://nightwatchjs.org/). -->

- **`src`**: contains the source code. The codebase is written in Typescript

  - **`classes`**: xxx.

    Consist of.

    - **`xxx`**: contains code related to xxx.

    - **`xxx`**: contains code related to xxx.

  - **`types`**: contains TypeScript type definitions.

    Consist of.

  - **`utils`**: xxx.

    Consist of.

  - `utils/xxx.ts`: xxx.
