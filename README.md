## Introduction

Soundcase (pronounced `/soundcaseː/`) is a web based **audio engine** for building awesome stuff. It is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable, and can easily scale between a library and a framework depending on different use cases. It consists of an approachable core library, and an ecosystem of supporting libraries that helps you tackle complexity in large Audio Applications.

#### Browser Compatibility

Soundcase supports all browsers that are [ES5-compliant](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/) (IE8 and below are not supported).
