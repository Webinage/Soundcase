## Introduction

Soundcase (pronounced `/saʊnd:keɪs/`) is a web based **audio engine** for building awesome audio stuff, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, sound engineer, educators, beginners, and anyone else! Soundcase is free and open-source because we believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone.
It is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable, and can easily scale between a library and a framework depending on different use cases. It consists of an approachable core library, and an ecosystem of supporting libraries that helps you tackle complexity in large Audio Applications.

#### Browser Compatibility

Soundcase supports all browsers that are [ES5-compliant](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/) (IE8 and below are not supported).
